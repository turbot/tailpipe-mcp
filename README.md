    - Example workflow and queries

You can load this prompt in Claude Desktop through the plug icon in the prompt window. The prompt will teach Claude how to:
- Use the appropriate tools to explore and understand your data
- Write efficient SQL queries using DuckDB syntax
- Follow consistent formatting and style conventions
- Work with data timestamps and freshness

## Installation

### Claude Desktop

[How to use MCP servers with Claude Desktop â†’](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

Add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tailpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "github:turbot/tailpipe-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This will automatically use the Tailpipe CLI to discover your database. If you want to specify a database file path explicitly, you can add it as an additional argument:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tailpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "github:turbot/tailpipe-mcp",
        "/path/to/your/tailpipe.db"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

To install the Tailpipe MCP server in Cursor:

1. Open your Cursor MCP configuration file:
   ```sh
   open ~/.cursor/mcp.json  # On macOS
   # or
   code ~/.cursor/mcp.json  # Using VS Code
   ```

2. Add the following configuration to enable automatic database discovery using the Tailpipe CLI:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tailpipe": {
         "name": "Tailpipe",
         "description": "Query Tailpipe data",
         "server": "github:turbot/tailpipe-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Alternatively, if you want to specify a database path explicitly:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tailpipe": {
         "name": "Tailpipe",
         "description": "Query Tailpipe data",
         "server": "github:turbot/tailpipe-mcp",
         "args": ["/path/to/your/tailpipe.db"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the configuration file and restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.

4. The Tailpipe MCP server will now be available in your Cursor environment.

## Prompting Guide

### Best Practices

The Tailpipe MCP includes a pre-built `best_practices` prompt. Running it before running your own prompts will teach the LLM how to work most effectively with Tailpipe, including:

- How to explore available data schemas and tables using tailpipe_table_list and tailpipe_table_show
- When to use specific tables for different resource types
- How to write efficient queries that follow Tailpipe conventions
- Best practices for formatting and presenting results

In Claude Desktop, you can load this prompt through the plug icon in the prompt window.

### Example Prompts

Each prompt below is designed to work with Tailpipe's table structure, where each resource type (buckets, instances, etc.) has its own table.

```
List all tables in the aws schema
```

```
What columns are in the aws_s3_bucket table?
```

```
Find S3 buckets that don't have encryption enabled
```

```
What EC2 instances have public IPs and are in a public subnet?
```

Remember to:
- Ask about specific resource types (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM users)
- Be clear about which services or schemas you're interested in
- Start with simple questions about one resource type
- Add more complexity or conditions after seeing the initial results

Claude will:
- Choose the appropriate Tailpipe tables for your request
- Write efficient SQL queries behind the scenes
- Format the results in a clear, readable way
- Provide insights and analysis based on your data

## Local Development

To set up the project for local development:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/tailpipe-mcp.git
cd tailpipe-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```sh
npm run build
```

4. For development with auto-recompilation:
```sh
npm run watch
```

5. To test locally:
```sh
# Run the main test (conversation with query testing)
npm test

# Test just the DuckDB connection
npm run test:duckdb

# Run a basic server test
npm run test:simple

# Set up for manual testing
npm run test:setup

# Clean up any leftover test files
npm run clean:tests
```

6. To run the server:

The MCP server can be run in two ways:

```sh
# Automatic database discovery (using Tailpipe CLI)
node dist/index.js

# Or with explicit database path
node dist/index.js /path/to/your/tailpipe.db

# Control log verbosity with environment variable
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG node dist/index.js
```

When run without arguments, the server will use the Tailpipe CLI to detect your database (`tailpipe connect --output json`). This requires the Tailpipe CLI to be installed and configured.

You can control the server behavior using environment variables:

- `TAILPIPE_MCP_DATABASE_PATH`: Specify the database path (alternative to command line argument)
- `TAILPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Control logging verbosity with these values:
  - `DEBUG`: Show all messages (most verbose)
  - `INFO`: Show informational, warning, and error messages (default)
  - `WARN`: Show only warning and error messages
  - `ERROR`: Show only error messages
  - `SILENT`: Disable all logging
- `TAILPIPE_MCP_DEBUG`: Set to 'true' to enable additional debug logging for Tailpipe CLI interactions

Example using environment variables:
```sh
TAILPIPE_MCP_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/db.db TAILPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG node dist/index.js
```

7. To use your local development version with Claude Desktop, update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tailpipe": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/workspace/dist/index.js",
        "/path/to/your/tailpipe.db"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/workspace` with the absolute path to your local development directory. For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/src/tailpipe-mcp`, you would use `~/src/tailpipe-mcp/dist/index.js`.

8. For local development with Cursor, update your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tailpipe": {
      "name": "Tailpipe",
      "description": "Query Tailpipe data",
      "command": "~/src/tailpipe-mcp/dist/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing with MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is helpful for testing and debugging. To test your local development version:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js

# Or with explicit database path:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js /path/to/your/tailpipe.db
```
